                                Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class. The child class will
                                inherit all
                                the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it
                                can have its own
                                properties and methods. An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword. <br>
                                In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or
                                class upon another
                                object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining
                                similar implementation.
                                Also defined as deriving new classes (sub classes) from existing ones such as super
                                class or base class and
                                then forming them into a hierarchy of classes. In most class-based object-oriented
                                languages, an object
                                created through inheritance, a "child object", acquires all the properties and behaviors
                                of the "parent
                                object" , with the exception of: constructors, destructor, overloaded operators and
                                friend functions of the
                                base class.

                                        <p>OOP is all about real-world objects and inheritance is a way of representing real-world relationships. 
                                            Here's an example – car, bus, bike – all of these come under a broader category called Vehicle. That 
                                            means they've inherited the properties of class vehicles i.e all are used for transportation.</p>
